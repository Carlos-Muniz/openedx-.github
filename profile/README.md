# Welcome to the Open edX project.

We're glad you're here!
This GitHub organization holds the code defining the Open edX platform,
including its services, libraries, frontends, tools, and more.
If you're trying to learn more, check out...

* the homepage: [openedx.org](https://openedx.org),
* the discussion forums: [discuss.edx.org](https://discuss.openedx.org/),
* the main LMS and CMS application repository: [edx-platform](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform),
* the official development tool: [devstack](https://github.com/edx/devstack), and
* the official installation method (also a development tool!): [tutor](https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/).

Although Open edX is built by many developers across different organizations,
the GitHub organization itself is operated by the Center for Reimagining Learning (tCRIL).
If, as an Open edX contributor,
you need GitHub setting changed or lack access that you believe you should have,
please [file a ticket with the tCRIL engineering team](https://github.com/openedx/tcril-engineering/issues/new/choose).
